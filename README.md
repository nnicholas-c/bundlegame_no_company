# Bundle Game

Order bundling behavioral experiment built with SvelteKit, Firebase, and map-based delivery flows.

Quick links: [Quick Setup](#quick-setup) | [Docs Hub](docs/README.md) | [Current Architecture](docs/current/ARCHITECTURE.md) | [Config and Datasets](docs/current/CONFIG_AND_DATASETS.md) | [Security](SECURITY.md)

## What This Project Does

- Runs the main bundling experiment and the tutorial flow.
- Stores runtime configuration and datasets in Firestore `MasterData`.
- Includes admin tooling for datasets, timing validation, city-travel configuration, analytics, and export.

## Quick Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nnicholas-c/bundlegame_no_company.git
cd bundlegame_no_company
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Fill in Firebase, MapTiler, and downloader credentials in `.env` before running locally.

Detailed setup: [docs/setup/QUICKSTART.md](docs/setup/QUICKSTART.md)

## Security

Before collecting real participant data, publish the Firestore rules from [`firestore.rules`](firestore.rules).

## Current Runtime Notes

Runtime configuration and experiment data are loaded from Firestore, not local static JSON.

Primary documents and grouped data:

- `MasterData/centralConfig`
- `MasterData/tutorialConfig`
- `MasterData/cities`
- `MasterData/datasets`

Timing semantics:

- Modeled order time = `estimatedTime + cityTravelTime`
- Runtime delivery leg = `localTravelTime + cityTravelTime`
- Cross-city travel comes from `MasterData/cities.travelTimes`
- Missing city routes are surfaced in the selection flow, delivery flow, and admin validation

## Classroom Live Leaderboard

The admin experience now supports a live class session workflow for running the game in class and projecting standings in real time.

### What It Does

- Adds a dedicated `/admin/live` page for a classroom leaderboard.
- Uses Firestore realtime listeners so rankings update without manual refresh.
- Shows a roster of everyone who joined the current class session, plus a podium, earnings chart, and ranked table.
- Uses participant ID as the displayed name.
- Ranks students by:
  - highest `earnings`
  - then highest `roundsCompleted`
  - then lowest `totalGameTime`
  - then participant ID

### Live Session Rules

- The instructor starts the class session from the admin dashboard before class.
- Only students who start the game while that session is active are added to the live leaderboard.
- Historical users are not pulled into the current class session automatically.
- The session is configured as a 20-minute classroom run for display/context only.
- Students are not removed when 20 minutes elapse, go idle, or stop updating temporarily.
- Students remain on the board until the admin explicitly ends the session.

### Firestore Shape

- `LiveSessions/{sessionId}`
- `LiveSessions/{sessionId}/participants/{participantId}`

Each live session stores:

- `sessionId`
- `label`
- `status`
- `startedAt`
- `endedAt`
- `plannedDurationMinutes`
- `scenarioSetVersionId`
- `scenarioSetName`

Each participant row stores:

- `participantId`
- `displayName`
- `earnings`
- `roundsCompleted`
- `optimalChoices`
- `totalGameTime`
- `completedGame`
- `status`
- `joinedAt`
- `lastActivityAt`
- `finalizedAt`

### Gameplay Integration

- New runs pick up the currently active live session when one exists.
- Mid-game progress saves update the live participant row alongside the usual summary/progress writes.
- Final completion marks the participant as completed on the live board but keeps them visible until the session is ended manually.

## Results And Reliability Updates

Two recent operational fixes matter for data collection and classroom use:

### End-Screen / Qualtrics Reliability

- Clipboard permission failures no longer trigger the fatal global error screen.
- The participant result code stays visible even when the browser blocks `navigator.clipboard.writeText(...)`.
- The end screen provides manual result-code confirmation as a fallback.
- Final completion now waits for confirmed Firebase persistence before the run is treated as complete.
- Recovery metadata is stored when the final save cannot be confirmed.
- The game is embedded in Qualtrics, so it cannot directly show or click Qualtrics' own Next button. It sends `postMessage` events instead: `mainGameComplete`, `mainGameRecoveryRequired`, and `resultCodeVerificationUpdated`.
- The end screen includes a `Continue to Qualtrics` button that re-sends the completion handoff with `advanceRequested: true` in case the original completion message was missed.

If Qualtrics hides Next on the embedded game page, the Qualtrics question JavaScript must listen for the game message and then show or click Next. Add this in the Qualtrics JavaScript editor for the question that embeds the game, adapting the embedded-data field names and the allowed origin:

```js
Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnload(function () {
  var question = this;
  var allowedOrigin = 'https://YOUR-GAME-HOST';

  question.hideNextButton();

  window.__bundleGameCompletionHandler = function (event) {
    if (event.origin !== allowedOrigin) return;

    var data = event.data || {};
    if (data.source !== 'bundlegame') return;

    var completionTypes = [
      'mainGameComplete',
      'mainGameRecoveryRequired',
      'resultCodeVerificationUpdated'
    ];
    if (completionTypes.indexOf(data.type) === -1) return;

    if (data.resultCode) {
      Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData('bundleGameResultCode', data.resultCode);
      Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData('bundleGameUserId', data.userId || '');
      Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.setEmbeddedData('bundleGameSaveStatus', data.saveStatus || '');
    }

    question.showNextButton();

    if (
      data.advanceRequested
      && data.type === 'mainGameComplete'
      && typeof question.clickNextButton === 'function'
    ) {
      question.clickNextButton();
    }
  };

  window.addEventListener('message', window.__bundleGameCompletionHandler);
});

Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnUnload(function () {
  if (window.__bundleGameCompletionHandler) {
    window.removeEventListener('message', window.__bundleGameCompletionHandler);
    window.__bundleGameCompletionHandler = null;
  }
});
```

### Results Page Improvements

- Result hydration now falls back across summary and progress data so `earnings`, `optimalChoices`, `roundsCompleted`, and `totalGameTime` do not disappear on newer records.
- The results page now exposes:
  - completion-date filtering
  - current-session filtering
  - custom date ranges
  - optional inclusion of undated legacy rows
  - explicit time/date quick sorts such as newest, oldest, fastest, and slowest

### New Summary Metadata

Participant summary/progress rows can now carry:

- `completionMeta`
- `liveSessionId`
- `sessionStartedAt`
- `lastActivityAt`
- `sessionLabel`

Before opening a PR:

- Run `npm run build`
- Check that Firebase-backed pages still load
- Update the relevant file in `docs/current/` when behavior changes
- Add or refresh the README `Recent Feature History` row when a meaningful feature ships

Commit prefixes used in this repo:

- `feat:` new behavior or feature
- `fix:` bug fix
- `docs:` documentation update
- `refactor:` structural change without intended behavior change
- `chore:` maintenance work

## Deployment and Export

Pushes to `main` deploy through Vercel.
